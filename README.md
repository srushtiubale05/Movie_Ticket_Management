# Movie_Ticket_Management
A desktop-based application developed using Java Swing and MySQL that simulates a real-world movie ticket booking platform. It allows users to browse movies, view available showtimes, book or cancel tickets, and perform mock payment processes. An admin module is also included to manage theaters, movies, showtimes, and bookings.
